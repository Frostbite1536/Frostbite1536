I'm a passionate Web3 leader with 4 years of experience building in the **Evmos ecosystem**. I specialize in scaling communities, executing high-impact decentralized governance, and bridging the gap between technical teams and users to solve complex problems and drive adoption.

## üèõÔ∏è Governance & Strategy

I drive ecosystem strategy through meticulous, community-aligned governance. My goal is to ensure the long-term health and capital efficiency of the DAO treasury.



* **100% Proposal Success Rate:** Authored and successfully passed 12+ on-chain governance proposals, securing funding and strategic direction for the ecosystem.
* **$1M+ Treasury Management:** Directed over 22 million EVMOS to fund key ecosystem initiatives, strategic partnerships, and community-driven projects.
* **Capital Efficiency:** Authored **Proposal 286** to create Community Owned Liquidity, transforming dormant funds into a productive, revenue-generating asset for the ecosystem.
* **Partner Onboarding:** Guided key protocols like **UniDex** (launching 48 derivatives markets) and **MYSO** through the entire governance and community launch process.

    üõ°Ô∏è A PROVEN TRACK RECORD OF TRUST & EXECUTION


    My work is defined by a deep commitment to transparency and a relentless drive to turn community consensus into on-chain action that delivers measurable results.



## üå± Ecosystem Growth & Community Building

A strong ecosystem is built on a thriving, engaged, and well-supported community. I helped scale the Evmos community from its launch into a global, multi-platform network.



* **50,000+ Member Community:** Grew and managed a global community across Telegram, Discord, Reddit, and Twitter, establishing the primary hubs for user engagement.
* **Community Advocacy:** Served as liaison between the community and the core development team, translating user feedback, bug reports, and sentiment into actionable insights.
* **Education & Content:** Published 84+ articles, guides, and analyses to demystify complex DeFi and governance topics. Founded **"The Diplomat Summary"** newsletter to keep the community informed.
* **Engagement:** Hosted numerous Twitter Spaces and Discord events with protocol builders, validators, and community members to foster transparency and collaboration.


## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Contributions & Security

Beyond community, I contribute directly to the technical health and stability of the ecosystem.


### Security & dApp Testing



* **Critical Vulnerability Discovery:** Identified and reported a critical "infinite money glitch" blockchain vulnerability, preventing millions in potential losses and safeguarding user funds.
* **Comprehensive QA:** Performed testing on ecosystem applications, providing detailed bug reports to enhance protocol stability and improve user experience.


### AI-Assisted Tool Development

As a strategic problem-solver, I identified key community challenges and leveraged AI to build open-source solutions:



* **Forge-Insight:** An analytics tool for the Forge DEX.
* **Telegram Statistics Extractor:** A bot to gather and export key community engagement metrics.
* **EvmosRosetta:** A translation bot designed to improve engagement for multi-lingual community members.
